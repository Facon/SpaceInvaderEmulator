# SpaceInvaderEmulator
Another Space Invaders emulator

# Background
After finishing the [Chip8Emulator](https://github.com/Facon/Chip8Emulator), I started implementing the [Space Invaders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Invaders) emulator. This is normally consider the next step in emulation creation.

This emulator is a major step compared with Chip8. For this project, you need to emulate the Intel 8080, a screen with vblank and handle interrupts properly.

Unfortunately, this project didn't go as good as expected, nonetheless, I learned a lot about computer architecture and C++ programming. This let me take an important step ahead in lessons at University on both areas.
I also learned that to start a complex emulator, it's a good idea to start implementing unit tests and integration test, otherwise, it gets quite complex to debug an emulator.
